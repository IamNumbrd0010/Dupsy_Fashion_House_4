        <strong> About the company </strong>
        </p>
      <p>Dupsy Aura Fashion House Ltd is a contemporary fashion brand that celebrates cultural diversity through design. The company specialises in creating bespoke and ready-to-wear garments that combine African textiles, craftsmanship, and aesthetics with modern Western tailoring. Our mission is to promote African creativity on the global stage and redefine how traditional fashion is represented internationally.
        The company’s vision is to establish itself as a bridge between African and Western fashion industries — supporting cultural exchange, innovation, and sustainable fashion practices. We are particularly focused on empowering local artisans, promoting ethical sourcing, and showcasing high-quality Afro-Western fusion fashion to international markets.
        In the United Kingdom, Dupsy Aura Fashion House Ltd aims to grow its presence through brand collaborations, pop-up showcases, and partnerships with designers, stylists, and cultural institutions. This expansion supports the UK’s creative industries by bringing new perspectives, diversity, and craftsmanship to its fashion ecosystem.
        As a founder/representative of the brand, my role includes leading design innovation, overseeing business operations, and driving the company’s strategic growth in both the UK and Nigeria. My focus is on establishing a sustainable creative enterprise that celebrates African heritage while contributing meaningfully to the UK’s global fashion influence.
